Given a group of 4, this is the project we came up with when designing our Mechatronic System

I present: My Autonomous Claw Machine!

The project was made to have two modes, Autonomous retrieval and racing mode

Racing mode gives the user the chance to control the physical system and retrieve the object they have specified from earlier. Their retrieval will be timed and will be checked against the robot.
After they have finished, they will return the object to its original location, the robot will reset, then use the same algorithm as Autonomous mode to retrieve the object.
If the user has a better time, they will be rewarded with an encouraging message by the system. If not, well, they lost, the robot is free to gloat as it pleases.

Autonomous mode simply prompts the user for a colour, then finds the colour. It will prompt the user to play again until it retrieves all the objects within its bounds.

Overall, a project used to practice the design and implementation of a Mechatronic System, uses RobotC (a C based language with many similarities to C++ except that it is not object-oriented), and C++
